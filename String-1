# Given a string name, e.g. "Bob", print a greeting of the form "Hello Bob!".

name = input("Enter name: ")
print("Hello " + name + "!")

# Given two strings, a and b, print the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".

a = "Hi"
b = "Bye"
print(a,b,b,a)

# The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. 
# In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay".
# Given tag and word strings, print the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".

a = "<i>"
b = "Yay"
c = "</i>"
print(a+b+c)
